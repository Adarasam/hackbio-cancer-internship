** **

 Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a critical worldwide health concern, as it undermines the efficacy of antimicrobials in treating common infections. This leads to escalating clinical outcomes, including longer hospital stays, higher healthcare costs, and higher morbidity rates, especially for cancer patients who are more vulnerable to infections and frequently have compromised immune systems (Ahmed _et al_., 2024). AMR is expected to cause 10 million deaths yearly by 2050, according to the World Health Organization, which lists it as one of the top ten worldwide dangers to public health (Mudenda _et al_., 2023).

 Due to their differences in structure, resistance mechanisms, and effect on patient outcomes, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are among the most important causes of these diseases. Microorganisms that are gram-negative possess a lipopolysaccharide-rich outer membrane. It has been discovered that a number of antimicrobials prevent this lipid from being synthesized, and more are likely to follow. Furthermore, Gram-negative bacteria's outer membranes can be bound by antimicrobial peptides, which prevents solutes from passing through to the outside of the cell and causes bacterial toxicity (Ganesan _et al_., 2023).

Bacterial enzymes can chemically alter phosphatidylglycerol, the main lipid component of Gram-positive bacteria, to change it from an anionic to a cationic or zwitterionic state. Bacteria that go through this process become more resistant to polycationic antibacterial treatments. The development of bacterial resistance would be prevented by the action of this enzyme's inhibitors.

 

Life-threatening infections in cancer patients are caused by a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, with _Staphylococci_, _Streptococci_, and_ Enterococci_ accounting for the majority of disease burden. _Acinetobacter baumannii_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ are gram-negative bacteria that have been linked to cancer patients (Maleki and Arjomandzadegan, 2023). Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria can cause infections in this population, with Gram-negative bacteria frequently leading to more serious consequences. These patients are more vulnerable to infections because to immunological suppression brought on by chemotherapy or the illness itself, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) makes matters worse by decreasing the efficacy of current therapies.

Cancer patients have a three-fold increased risk of dying from a fatal infection and are more likely to develop a variety of infections that can have worse outcomes (Lin and Park, 2024). Recent advances in cancer management are at risk due to the widespread resistance of infections produced by different pathogens in cancer patients to antimicrobials. Sadly, these infections frequently force medical practitioners to delay or stop planned cancer therapy, which worsens the outlook for cancer patients.
